This is my portfolio website built during my time with Central New Mexico Community College Deep Dive Full-Stack web developer bootcamp. 
Please take a look around and ask any questions that come to mind. 
I made sure to maximize use of 'flowbite' CSS library as while as plain JS to power the portfolio. 

Thank you for visiting!
